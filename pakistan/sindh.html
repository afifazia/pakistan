    <h1>SINDH:</h1>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Sindh is the third largest province by size, and second largest province by population. It is
     bordered by Baluchistan province to the west, Punjab province to the north, the Indian states of
     Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east, and Arabian Sea to the south.</p>
     <h2>National Food:</h2>
     <p>Kadhi Chawal is Sindh's signature dish. The dense curry is a mixture of gram flour and water.
     It also has other important ingredients such as okra, cluster beans, turmeric, drumstick, and 
     curry leaves. This mouth-watering curry is eaten along with steamed rice and sweet boondi (small
     fried gram flour mixture balls).</p>
     <h2>National Dress:</h2>
     <p>Sindhi women and men wear the Shalwar Qameez or the Kurta with Pyjama. Women also wear Sari
     or ghagra. However, before the adoption of the Shalwar kameez, kurta, the Sari as well as other
     articles of clothing, Sindhis had their own traditional costumes.</p>
     <h2>Culture:</h2>
     <p>The Culture of Sindh as its roots in the Indus Valley civilization. Sindh has been shaped by
     the largely desert region, the natural resources it has available, and continuous foreign 
     influence. The Indus or Sindhu River, which passes through the land, and the Arabian Sea (Which
     defines its borders) also supported the seafaring traditions among the local people. The local
     climate also reflects why the Sindhis have a language, folklore, traditions, customs, and
     lifestyle that are so different from the neighbouring regions.The Sindhi culture is also practised
     by the Sindhi diaspora.</p>
